## About me

As a security consultan, I apply my extensive knowledge and experience in DevSecOps and cloud security to help clients enhance their security posture and resilience. With over 3 years of experience in cybersecurity, I have developed a keen eye for detecting and resolving vulnerabilities, conducting risk assessments, and implementing security measures to mitigate potential threats.

I am passionate about staying on top of the latest trends and technologies in the industry, ensuring that I can provide effective and up-to-date solutions. I am also an avid learner and a proud CTF player Hackthebox, who enjoys participating in cybersecurity events, conferences, and online forums. I value collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I strive to empower and support my colleagues and peers in their cybersecurity journey
